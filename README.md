# Claude Code Git Workflow Commands 🚀

A collection of powerful git workflow commands for Claude Code that enable parallel development, automated PR creation, and seamless GitHub integration.

## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains custom commands that enhance Claude Code's ability to work with Git and GitHub, enabling:

- **Parallel Development**: Work on multiple issues simultaneously using git worktrees
- **Automated Workflows**: From issue creation to PR merge in one command
- **Smart Branching**: Consistent branch naming without slashes for worktree compatibility
- **Session Management**: Track multiple Claude instances in WezTerm panels
- **Environment Sync**: Automatic `.env` file management across worktrees

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to `~/.claude`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-workflow.git ~/.claude
```

2. Ensure Claude Code can access the commands:
```bash
# Commands are automatically available when placed in ~/.claude/commands/
```

3. Set up shell aliases for convenience:
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
alias cl='claude'
alias cld='claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'
```

### Command Usage Note

All commands accept arguments with or without quotes:
```bash
# Both of these work identically:
/user:gw-yolo Add user authentication
/user:gw-yolo "Add user authentication"

# Useful for quick typing:
/user:gw-iss-create Fix login bug          # Plans and creates through consultation (ultrathink)
/user:gw-iss-create -l think Fix typo      # Quick analysis for simple tasks
/user:gw-iss-create -f Fix login bug       # Force immediate creation (old behavior)
/user:gw-yolo Update README                 # Plans, creates issue, implements (consultation)
/user:gw-yolo -f Update README              # Immediate execution (old YOLO behavior)
```

### Standard Workflow (Recommended)

**Note**: Issue/PR numbers can be specified with or without `#` - both `33` and `#33` work identically.

```bash
# Basic flow (auto push & PR):
/user:gw-iss-create        # 1. Plan and create issue through consultation
/user:gw-iss-run #33       # 2. Start implementation → push → PR

# Cautious flow (review before push):
/user:gw-iss-create        # 1. Plan and create issue through consultation
/user:gw-iss-implement #33 # 2. Start implementation (commits only)

# Optional: Use gw-commit for granular commits during development
/user:gw-commit -p "add user model"      # Commit specific changes
/user:gw-commit -p "implement auth API"  # Commit feature by feature
/user:gw-commit -i                       # Interactive mode for final cleanup

/user:gw-push              # 3. Push and create PR when ready

# Parallel flow (try multiple approaches):
/user:gw-iss-create        # 1. Plan and create issue through consultation

# Option A: With auto push/PR
/user:gw-iss-run-parallel #33 -p 3  # 2a. Create 3 parallel implementations (auto push/PR)

# Option B: Local only
/user:gw-iss-implement-parallel #33 -p 3  # 2b. Create 3 parallel implementations (local only)

/user:gw-iss-status #33    # 3. Check progress of all variants
/user:gw-editor -a         # 4. Open all worktrees to compare
# Choose best implementation and create PR from that branch

# Optional steps:
/user:gw-iss-edit #33      # Edit issue with consultation (safer)
/user:gw-iss-edit #33 -f   # Quick edit without review
/user:gw-iss-context #33   # Load existing issue context
/user:gw-editor #33        # Open in editor for review after completion

# After PR is approved:
/user:gw-pr-merge #34      # Merge PR with squash and cleanup worktree
```

### YOLO Workflow (Thoughtful & Effective 🚀)

```bash
# Default: Plan first, then implement (quotes optional)
/user:gw-yolo Add user authentication feature
# Shows plan → you approve → creates issue #33, implements, creates PR #34

# Skip planning for speed (original YOLO behavior)
/user:gw-yolo Add user authentication feature -f
# Immediately creates issue #33, implements, creates PR #34

# Note: I often use 'cld' alias (--dangerously-skip-permissions) for speed

# After PR is approved:
/user:gw-pr-merge #34      # Merge PR with squash and cleanup worktree
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Git Worktree Integration
All commands create worktrees in `./worktrees/` subdirectory with branch-based naming:
```
./worktrees/feat-33-add-auth/
./worktrees/fix-34-login-bug/
./worktrees/docs-35-update-readme/
```

### 2. Parallel Development
Work on multiple implementations simultaneously:
```bash
# Create 3 parallel implementations (deepseek-reasoner by default)
/user:gw-iss-run-parallel 33 -p 3

# Use deepseek-chat model for faster responses
/user:gw-iss-run-parallel 33 -p 3 -m deepseek-chat

# Opens tmux with:
# - Terminal 1: ./worktrees/feat-33-auth-claude1/ (with selected model)
# - Terminal 2: ./worktrees/feat-33-auth-claude2/ (with selected model)
# - Terminal 3: ./worktrees/feat-33-auth-claude3/ (with selected model)
```

### 3. Smart Branch Naming
Branches use hyphens instead of slashes for perfect worktree compatibility:
- ✅ `feat-33-add-authentication`
- ✅ `fix-34-resolve-memory-leak`
- ❌ ~~`feat/33-add-authentication`~~ (not used)

### 4. Session Display
Every command shows session context for WezTerm panel management:
```
🌿 Branch: main | 🌲 Worktree: main | 🆔 01JFK6YZ8KQXJ2V3P9M7N5R4TC | 📌 claude-1234 | 🤖 deepseek-reasoner
```

The session display includes:
- 🆔 Actual Claude Code session ID (use with `claude -r` to resume)
- 📌 Visual identifier for distinguishing WezTerm panels
- 🤖 Current model (deepseek-reasoner/deepseek-chat) in each parallel terminal

### 5. TodoWrite Integration
Automatic task synchronization between Claude's TodoWrite and GitHub issue checkboxes.

### 6. Group Cleanup
`gw-pr-merge` automatically cleans up ALL related worktrees and branches for the same issue:
- Detects all variants (claude1, claude2, etc.) by issue number
- Removes all worktrees in one command
- Deletes all local branches
- Perfect for parallel implementation workflows

### 7. Automatic Environment Sync
All worktree-creating commands now automatically sync `.env` files:
- `gw-yolo`, `gw-iss-run`, `gw-iss-implement`
- No need to manually run `gw-env-sync` after worktree creation
- Ensures immediate development readiness

### 8. Privacy Options
Control what information is included in GitHub issues:
- Use `-np` or `--no-prompt` to exclude original request
- Useful for sensitive information or private details
- Available in `gw-iss-create` and `gw-yolo` commands

## 📖 Example Workflows

### Complete Development Lifecycle
```bash
# 1. Create issue and implement
/user:gw-iss-create        # Plan and create issue #33 (consultation mode)
/user:gw-iss-run #33       # Implement, test, push, create PR #34

# 2. After PR review and approval
/user:gw-pr-merge #34      # Merge with squash & cleanup ALL related worktrees

# The worktree AND any parallel variants are automatically removed!
```

### Standard Feature Development
```bash
# 1. Start with an idea (quotes are optional)
/user:gw-yolo Add search functionality to user dashboard
# or
/user:gw-yolo "Add search functionality to user dashboard"

# Claude will:
# - Create GitHub issue #45
# - Create branch: feat-45-add-search-functionality
# - Create worktree: ./worktrees/feat-45-add-search-functionality/
# - Implement the feature
# - Run tests
# - Create PR when ready

# 2. After approval:
/user:gw-pr-merge #46      # Merge PR and cleanup
```

### Working on Existing Issue
```bash
# For existing issues, you can skip creation:
/user:gw-iss-run #38       # Directly start implementation → push → PR

# Or use implement for local work only:
/user:gw-iss-implement #38 # Work locally without pushing
# Review changes...
/user:gw-push             # Push when ready

# Or load context first if you want Claude to understand the issue:
/user:gw-iss-context #38   # Read and analyze issue
/user:gw-iss-run #38       # Then start implementation
```

### Understanding Past Implementations
```bash
# Analyze how a bug was fixed
/user:gw-commit-context fix-commit-sha -v
# Claude understands the fix approach and rationale

# Research feature implementation before refactoring
/user:gw-commit-context feat-original-sha
# Claude silently loads context about implementation patterns

# Quick review of recent changes
/user:gw-commit-context HEAD -l think --no-diff
# Fast understanding without full diff analysis
```

### Parallel Implementation Comparison
```bash
# 1. Create multiple approaches (requires tmux)
/user:gw-iss-run-parallel #52 -p 3
# This opens tmux with 3 panes, each running Claude in a different worktree

# 2. Check progress
/user:gw-iss-status #52

# 3. Open all in editor to compare
/user:gw-editor -a

# 4. Choose best implementation and create PR from it
# 5. When PR is approved, merge and cleanup ALL variants
/user:gw-pr-merge #46  # Removes all 3 worktrees automatically!
```

### Fixing CI Failures
```bash
# 1. Automated CI fix
/user:gw-pr-fix #67

# Claude will:
# - Analyze CI failures
# - Create worktree from PR branch
# - Fix issues iteratively
# - Push when all checks pass
```

### Working from Main Branch
```bash
# Accidentally started work on main branch?
# Make your changes...

# Then safely create branch and PR:
/user:gw-push-from-main
# or with specific branch name:
/user:gw-push-from-main feat-new-feature

# Claude will:
# - Create new branch from main
# - Move all your changes
# - Create commit and push
# - Create PR automatically
```

### Closing PRs Without Merge
```bash
# Simple close
/user:gw-pr-close #45

# With direct comment
/user:gw-pr-close #45 -c "Requirements changed, closing this approach"

# With generated professional message
/user:gw-pr-close #45 -p "not working as expected"
# Generates: "Technical issues prevent this implementation from meeting requirements.
#            Closing to explore alternative approaches."

# All variants cleanup worktrees/branches automatically
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Required Tools
